# Python AntiScam Spammer

## Overview

This was made by [Engineer Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtNYzv8gLbs) and the original can be found on his [GitHub](https://github.com/engineer-man/youtube/tree/master/033).

My plan is to tweak it slightly to make harder to find email addresses and more realistic passwords.

## Plan

1. [x] Duplicate Engineer Man's [code](https://github.com/engineer-man/youtube/tree/master/033)
1. [ ] Add last names 
1. [ ] Update email to do a mix of the following:
    1. [ ] Firstname
    1. [ ] Lastname
    1. [ ] FirstnameLastname
    1. [ ] Firstname.Lastname
    1. [ ] LastnameFirstname
    1. [ ] Lastname
    1. [ ] All previous but with characters
    1. [ ] All previous but with symbols
    1. [ ] All previous but with symbols and characters
1. [ ] Send multiple email addresses instead of just "@yahoo.com"
1. [ ] Create realistic passwords
