# Python AntiScam Spammer

## Overview

This was made by [Engineer Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtNYzv8gLbs) and the original can be found on his [GitHub](https://github.com/engineer-man/youtube/tree/master/033).

My plan is to tweak it slightly to make harder to find email addresses and more realistic passwords.

## Plan

1. [x] Duplicate Engineer Man's [code](https://github.com/engineer-man/youtube/tree/master/033)
1. [x] Add last names 
1. [x] Update email to do a mix of the following:
    1. [x] FirstnameLastname
    1. [x] Firstname.Lastname
    1. [x] Firstname\_Lastname
    1. [x] Firstname-Lastname
    1. [x] LastnameFirstname
    1. [x] Lastname.Firstname
    1. [x] Lastname\_Firstname
    1. [x] Lastname-Firstname
    1. [x] All previous but with digits 
1. [x] Send multiple email addresses instead of just "@yahoo.com"
1. [ ] Create realistic passwords
